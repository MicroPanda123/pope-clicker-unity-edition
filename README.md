# pope-clicker-unityedition
Pope clicker by Jacekpoz but made in Unity

Pope Clicker recreated in Unity, because of problems with files, this repository will only contain assets with code, meta packages and releases.

This game is recreation of Jacekpoz's project with the same title: https://github.com/jacekpoz/pope-clicker

The whole game is meant as a joke, it's not meant to offend anyone, but if you think something I add is too much, feel free to tell me.

This is very raw version, for now it lacks: particles, achievements, some objects in store
